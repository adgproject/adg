The ADG Project
===============

Description
-----------
ADG is a tool generating diagrams and producing their expressions for given
many-body formalisms. Diagrammatic rules from the formalism are combined with
graph theory objects to produce diagrams and expressions in a fast, simple and
error-safe way.

The only input consists in the theory and order of interest, and the N-body
character of the operators of interest. The main output is a LaTeX file
containing the diagrams, their associated expressions and additional
informations that can be compiled into PDF by ADG if needed. Other
computer-readable files may be produced as well.


Status
------
As for now, the code is capable of handling four different formalisms, i.e.
Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT), Bogoliubov Many-Body Perturbation
Theory (BMBPT), Projected Bogoliubov Many-Body Perturbation Theory (PBMBPT),
and Bogoliubov In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (BIMSRG).

- For MBPT, the code generates all Hartree-Fock energy diagrams at any given
  order along with their expression and additional information
  (conjugate diagram, excitation level...).
- For (P)BMBPT, the code generates all diagrams for a generic observable
  commuting with the Hamiltonian, along with their time-dependent and
  time-integrated expressions.
- For BIMSRG, the code generates all diagrams and expressions at any given
  truncation order for the two operators as well as the commutator itself.
  The traditional BIMSRG(n) truncation order corresponds to truncating both
  operators as well as the commutator at the same rank.

Future developments
-------------------
ADG is currently being extended to diagrams and expressions generation for
Gorkov Self-Consistent Green's Functions (GSCGF).
